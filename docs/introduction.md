# Introduction

## What is ML Copilot Agent?

**ML Copilot Agent** simplifies the machine learning workflow by automating repetitive tasks and providing an interactive interface. It is especially useful for quick prototyping and for those who prefer an assisted approach to machine learning.

## How Does It Work?

The agent uses OpenAI's language models to interpret user commands and generate the necessary code, which it then executes to perform tasks. This allows for a flexible and powerful workflow that adapts to your needs.

## Why Use ML Copilot Agent?

- **Efficiency**: Automate routine tasks to save time.
- **Accessibility**: Lower the barrier to entry for machine learning tasks.
- **Customization**: Tailor processes with custom instructions.
